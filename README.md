**_Aleph-null_** (or
_Aleph-naught_ or _aleph-zero_) is the
[cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality) of the set of [natural
numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number).

Similaraly to functional programming (which this library is about)
__Aleph-null__ has something to do with __mathematics__ (set theory),
__immutability__, and __beer__:

> back up, 99 bottles of beer on the wall (repeat).
